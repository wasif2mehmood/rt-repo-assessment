   cd github-readme-enhancer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your OpenAI key**

   **Option A: Using `.env` file**

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
   ```

   **Option B: Using Streamlit secrets (`.streamlit/secrets.toml`)**

   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**

   ```
   streamlit run main.py


##  How to Use

   * Generate enhanced title and introduction.
   * Suggest missing metadata and sections.
   * Validate against the current repo content.
4. Review suggestions, copy, and update your README.




## Limitations

* Best suited for GitHub repositories with a README already in place.
