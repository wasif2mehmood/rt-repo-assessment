An advanced multi-agent system that analyzes cryptocurrency sentiment with deep context.
Cryptosentinator uses a crew of specialized AI agents to gather data, perform nuanced NLP analysis, formulate strategic market hypotheses, and immediately evaluate its own performance.


## ✨ Live Demo

This project is deployed as an interactive Gradio application on Hugging Face Spaces. Try it live!

## 🚀 Key Features
 
-  🧠 **Multi-Agent Crew:** Employs four specialized agents (Scout, Analyst, Strategist, Evaluator) for a sophisticated division of labor.
-  📊 **Deep Contextual Analysis:** Moves beyond simple "positive/negative" scores by using **topic modeling** to understand *why* the sentiment exists.
-  📝 **Actionable Hypotheses:** The Strategist Agent delivers a clear, human-readable market hypothesis, not just raw data.
-  🔍 **Integrated Self-Evaluation:** A unique Evaluator Agent provides an immediate performance score on every run, creating a trust-building feedback loop.
-  ✅ **Production-Ready Design:** Built with containerization, robust error handling, and secure secrets management in mind. 

## 🛠️ System Architecture

The system operates as a sequential pipeline where each agent enhances the data, culminating in a self-evaluated, actionable report.

```mermaid

    A[Start: Input Keywords e.g., 'Bitcoin'] --> B(Scout Agent);
    B -- Gathers Raw Documents --> C(Intelligence Analyst Agent);
    C -- Consumes Raw Documents & Produces Processed Documents (sentiment + topic) --> D(Strategist Agent);
    D -- Synthesizes Processed Documents & Market Data --> E(Strategic Summary);

    E --> F(Evaluator Agent);
    B -- Raw Documents --> F;

    F -- Generates Performance Evaluation --> G[End: Final Report];
    E -- Strategic Summary --> G;

```

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Orchestration:** LangChain & LangGraph
- **LLM Provider:** GeminiAI
- **UI Layer:** Gradio
- **Testing:** Pytest & Pytest-Mock
- **Containerization:** Docker (Optional)


## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Git
-   Python 3.9+
-   An Gemini API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd cryptosentinator-v2
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Your API Key**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory. This file will store your secret API key.
    ```.env
     API_KEY="sk-YourSecret_ApiKey"
    ```
The application will automatically load this key. The .gitignore file is already configured to ignore .env files.

## 🚀 How to Run
### Run the Interactive UI

To launch the Gradio web interface, run the following command from the project root:
```sh
gradio app.py
```

Open the local URL provided (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) in your browser.

### Run the Test Suite
To verify the integrity of all components, run the test suite:

```bash
pytest

```
or
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --maxfail=5 --disable-warnings -q

```

## 🧪 Testing, Validation, and Security

This repository contains a comprehensive test suite and follows best practices for security and error handling.

### Test Suite

The project uses pytest for testing. The test suite, located in the /tests directory, provides excellent coverage for all critical components.
- **Unit Tests:** Each agent's logic and each tool's functionality are tested in isolation.
- **Mocking:** All external API calls are mocked using pytest-mock, ensuring tests are fast, deterministic, and free to run.

### Input Validation & Error Handling

- **Input Validation:** The Gradio interface provides basic sanitization. The backend create_interactive_pipeline function also checks for empty or invalid user input and returns a user-friendly warning.
- **Resilience:** Critical pipeline steps are wrapped in try...except blocks. For example, if an NLP analysis fails, the system returns a neutral default value instead of crashing, ensuring the pipeline can complete.
- **User Feedback:** Clear error messages are displayed on the UI if a backend process fails, while detailed tracebacks are printed to the console for debugging.

### Security Precautions

- **Secrets Management:** API keys are never hardcoded. The application reads secrets from environment variables. For local development, this is managed via the .env file (which is git-ignored).
For deployment on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, secrets are stored securely using the platform's built-in secrets manager.
